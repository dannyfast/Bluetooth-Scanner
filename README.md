# Features
* Testing tool for implementing bluetooth with *Python* using the bluetooth module
* The Script scansall available nearby devices and neatly lists the details
* Details listed include Mac ID, Device Name and device class (split into seperate bin identifiers)
* There is an additional method in the class *find_services(self, addr)* that may be called to list down all advertised services on that particular devices represented by its address _addr_

## Bugs
I have noticed that sometimes it obatins a listing of devices from cache of some sort
